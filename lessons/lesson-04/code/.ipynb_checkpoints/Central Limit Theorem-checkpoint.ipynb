    "# Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The central limit theorem is a fundamental tool in statistics. It says, with some assumptions, that sampling distributions are normal with a specific mean and variance. It's a vital tool in data science when working with large data sets. Often a random sample (or many random samples) can tell us crucial information about a much larger dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you work at a large social media company and you want to estimate the distribution of the ages of your users for targetting ads, you could extract the ages of hundreds of millions of users from your database and compute the distribution. This will take a lot of time and effort, and it's usually enough to simply look at a much smaller but random subset of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually we do not know the true distribution of our data so we study it by looking at the distribution of random samples. It turns out that we can often identify the underlying \"true\" distribution within any necessary degree of approximation as long as we can obtain enough data."
